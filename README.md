# Hungry_horses_1.0

Hungry horses 1.0 is a game of two opponents. Each one controls a horse on a chessboard. On the board, there are 14 squares with grass, 5 with flowers, and 2 with apples.

When a horse eats a lawn he earns one point, when he eats a flower he makes three points, and when he eats an apple he earns five points. Whoever gets the most points wins the game. Hungry horses 1.0 features three levels of difficulty, beginner, amateur and expert, which the user can select when starting the game.

## Technical explanation

The machine horse gets smarter depending on the level of difficulty chosen by the user. To do this, we implemented Artificial Intelligence algorithms building a [MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) tree with imperfect decisions, the depth limit of the tree depends on the level selected by the user. For beginner level, a depth equal to 2 is used, for amateur depth is 4, and for expert, the depth limit is 6.


## Players
- User -> Black horse
- Machine -> White horse

Remember that the horse moves are exactly the same as the ones used in chess.
