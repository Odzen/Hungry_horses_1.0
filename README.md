# Hungry_horses_1.0

Hungry horses 1.0 is a game of two opponents. Each one controls a horse on a chessboard. On the board, there are 14 squares with grass, 5 with flowers, and 2 with apples.

When a horse eats a lawn he earns one point, when he eats a flower he makes three points, and when he eats an apple he earns five points. Whoever gets the most points wins the game. Hungry horses 1.0 features three levels of difficulty, beginner, amateur and expert, which the user can select when starting the game.

User -> Black horse
Machine -> White horse

Remember that the horse moves are exactly the same as the ones used in chess.
